            <h3>A Little About Me</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Audry Ford and I have a love for plants and technology. I have been working in retail the last few years and decided it is time for a change.
            </p>
            <p>
                My fiance and I have been together three years now and we have one son, Charlie. He will be two in October and he is the light of our life.
            </p>
            <p>
                I grew up in a small town in Missouri and never could quite figure out what I wanted to do for a career. Once I started learning about coding and all you can do with it, I knew this is what I wanted to do.
